    <h1>FlashApp End User License Agreement (EULA)</h1>
    
    <p>Last updated: December 1, 2025</p>

    <p>Apps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to FlashApp ("the App") is subject to your prior acceptance of this End User License Agreement ("EULA"). Your license is granted by Apple for the App Store version of FlashApp, and by the Application Provider for any third-party components.</p>

    <h2>1. Scope of License</h2>
    <p>Licensor grants you a nontransferable license to use FlashApp on any Apple-branded products you own or control. You may not distribute, sublicense, copy (except as permitted), reverse-engineer, or create derivative works of the App or its updates, except as permitted by law.</p>

    <h2>2. Subscription Terms</h2>
    <p>FlashApp offers auto-renewable subscriptions. Payment will be charged to your Apple ID at the time of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your App Store account settings.</p>

    <h2>3. Consent to Use of Data</h2>
    <p>Licensor may collect and use technical data about your device, system, and app usage to provide updates, product support, and improvements. Data will be used in a form that does not personally identify you.</p>

    <h2>4. Termination</h2>
    <p>This EULA is effective until terminated. Your rights will automatically terminate if you fail to comply with any terms.</p>

    <h2>5. External Services</h2>
    <p>FlashApp may enable access to third-party services and websites ("External Services"). You agree to use these at your own risk. Licensor is not responsible for third-party content or accuracy, and External Services may not be available in all regions.</p>

    <h2>6. No Warranty</h2>
    <p>FlashApp is provided "as is" and "as available," without any warranties. Licensor disclaims all express, implied, or statutory warranties, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Licensor is not liable for any incidental, indirect, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App. Total liability is limited to fifty dollars ($50.00), except as may be required by law for personal injury.</p>

    <h2>8. Export Restrictions</h2>
    <p>You may not export or re-export the App except as authorized by U.S. law. You represent that you are not in a U.S.-embargoed country and not on restricted lists.</p>

    <h2>9. Government End Users</h2>
    <p>The App and documentation are licensed as "Commercial Items" under U.S. law for government end users.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>This EULA is governed by the laws of California, excluding conflicts of law. You submit to the personal, non-exclusive jurisdiction of courts in Santa Clara County, California, for any disputes. EU, Swiss, Norwegian, or Icelandic users are governed by the law of their usual residence.</p>
